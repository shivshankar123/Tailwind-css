        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a
        comprehensive set of classes to help you build custom designs quickly
        and efficiently. Instead of writing custom CSS for each component, you
        use Tailwind's pre-defined utility classes directly in your HTML to
        apply styles. This approach speeds up development and ensures a
        consistent design system.
